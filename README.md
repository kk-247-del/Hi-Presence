# Hi Presence
### A House of Ariaka Project

**Hi Presence** is a co-presence environment where interaction is a live state, not a stored object. 

## 📱 Current Deployment Status
- [x] **Android:** Live and Deployed.
- [ ] **iOS:** In Development (Finalizing E2EE Handshake). **Status: Coming Soon.**
- [ ] **Windows:** Phase 2 (In Review).
- [x] **Web Bridge:** Live (Seamless join for non-app users; 3-Moment limit).

## 📁 Feature Spotlight: The "Reveal" System (Upcoming)
Hi Presence is moving toward a **No-Transfer** media philosophy.
* **Projection, Not Transmission:** Files are never "sent." Instead, the host "Reveals" the file.
* **Live Rendering:** The originator renders the media locally and streams the representation to the participant. 
* **Zero Asset Exposure:** The raw file never leaves the source device, ensuring absolute document security.

## 🔐 Security Framework
* **Character-Level E2EE:** Live Text is projected key-by-key with ephemeral RSA/AES encryption.
* **Warm Voice Pipeline:** Secure P2P audio is available for instant escalation.
* **Collapse Engine:** Total memory wipe and session teardown the moment focus is lost.
