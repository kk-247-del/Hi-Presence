# Hi Presence
### A House of Ariaka Project

**Hi Presence** is a real-time co-presence environment that rejects the metaphor of "messaging as exchange." [cite_start]It is not a messenger; it is a state of shared presence where nothing is sent, received, or stored[cite: 91, 94].

## 🔐 The Security Manifesto
* [cite_start]**Character-Level E2EE:** Live Text is encrypted and projected key-by-key[cite: 13]. [cite_start]There is no "send" button because there is no "message object"[cite: 140].
* [cite_start]**Always-Warm Voice:** A secure, end-to-end encrypted audio pipeline is maintained within every Moment for seamless escalation[cite: 106, 109].
* [cite_start]**Zero Knowledge:** House of Ariaka servers act only as a signaling layer and never see text, voice, or keys[cite: 82].

## 🚀 Deployment & Accessibility
Hi Presence is a cross-platform environment designed to eliminate onboarding friction.
* **Android & iOS:** Fully deployed and active.
* **Windows:** Phase 2 implementation in progress.
* **Presence Address (Web Bridge):** Invite colleagues via a one-time link. They join seamlessly through the web app without an installation. Web sessions are limited to **3 Moments** per user to encourage native app adoption and ensure structural integrity.

## 📁 Upcoming: The "Reveal" System
[cite_start]We are reframing media interaction as **Co-presence Without Transfer**[cite: 29].
* **Media Projection:** Photos, videos, and documents are never "sent" as files. [cite_start]Instead, they are **Revealed**[cite: 30, 121].
* [cite_start]**Rendered Representations:** The host renders the media locally and streams only the frames or pages to the viewer[cite: 122, 123].
* [cite_start]**No Assets Shared:** The raw file never leaves the originator's device, and all buffers are destroyed upon Moment collapse[cite: 124, 129].

## 🛠 Engineering Laws
1. [cite_start]**No Presence, No State:** Interaction exists only when participants are foregrounded[cite: 147].
2. [cite_start]**Immediate Collapse:** Any violation of focus (screen lock/backgrounding) triggers an irreversible teardown of keys and data[cite: 152, 306].
3. [cite_start]**No Send Primitive:** Communication is expressed and revealed, never delivered[cite: 148].
