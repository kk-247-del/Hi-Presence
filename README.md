# Hi Presence
### A House of Ariaka Project

Hi Presence is an environment for **Co-presence**, where interaction is a live state rather than a stored object.

## 📱 Status & Availability
- **Android:** [Live] Full Native E2EE.
- **Web Bridge:** [Live] Seamless join via Presence Address (3-Moment limit).
- **iOS:** [Waiting List] Finalizing hardware-level E2EE handshakes.
- **Windows:** [Phase 2] Internal Review.

## 🛠 Active Engineering (Blueprint Phases)
The following features are currently under development and not yet available in the production build:

* **The "Reveal" System:** A file-less media interaction protocol. Content is rendered locally and "projected" to participants via E2EE stream. The raw file never leaves the originator's device.
* **Drift Windows:** A coordination layer that allows for fluid, non-obligatory availability spans.

## 🔐 Privacy & Security
Privacy is a constraint, not a policy.
* **Character-Level E2EE:** Live text is projected key-by-key.
* **Warm Audio:** Secure P2P voice escalation.
* **Collapse Engine:** Automatic memory wipe and session teardown on focus loss.
